# About the project

This is a console based _Mancala_ game with _Minimax algorithm_ for AI player. You'll be playing against the computer, which uses an implementation of the Minimax algorithm to make its moves.

## About the game

Mancala is a traditional and strategic board game that dates back hundreds of years. It's played with small stones, seeds, or beads that are distributed among pits or hollows on the board. The objective of the game is to capture as many of your opponent's pieces as possible while keeping your own side well-stocked. Mancala games can vary in rules and the number of pits used, but the core concept involves strategic moves and counting to outmaneuver your opponent. It's a game that combines skill, tactics, and mathematical thinking, making it a popular choice for players of all ages.

## About Minimax

Minimax is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player, zero-sum games like chess or tic-tac-toe. The algorithm aims to find the optimal move for a player by evaluating potential outcomes and selecting the move that minimizes the maximum possible loss. It works by simulating all possible moves, creating a game tree, and then assigning values to each possible outcome. Minimax seeks to maximize a player's advantage while minimizing their opponent's advantage, ultimately helping to make strategic decisions in competitive games.
