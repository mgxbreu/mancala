# About the game

Mancala is a traditional and strategic board game that dates back hundreds of years. It's played with small stones, seeds, or beads that are distributed among pits or hollows on the board. The objective of the game is to capture as many of your opponent's pieces as possible while keeping your own side well-stocked. Mancala games can vary in rules and the number of pits used, but the core concept involves strategic moves and counting to outmaneuver your opponent. It's a game that combines skill, tactics, and mathematical thinking, making it a popular choice for players of all ages.
